======================

**simplify-display-statistics** is an extension for Apache Guacamole which
applies cosmetic changes intended to simplify the appearance of the frame
statistics toolbar provided by the "guacamole-display-statistics" extension:

* The Guacamole client and server framerates, mainly of use to developers, are
  hidden from view.
* The header for the rate of dropped frames is reworded from "Drop" to "Dropped
  Frames".
